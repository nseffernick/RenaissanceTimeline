            <p class="hide txt" id="petrarch-text">Born in 1304 and dying in 1374, Petrarch is considered the father of humanism. One of the pillars of the start to humanism is classical antiquity, which can be described as looking back at previous cultures like the Greek and Romans,
                then appreciating and applying their works to their current culture. Petrarch started this movement by discovering forgotten letters by the Roman statesman Cicero, “The Letters to Atticus”, in a library in Verona. Furthermore, he had great love to Latin accounts of
                Homer’s the Iliad and Odyssey. To express his enjoyment for these works Petrarch wrote a collection of 10 letters to these now dead men called the “Familiar Letters.” These letters are written as very personal dialogues, asking Cicero why he engaged himself so much
                in politics that would lead to his assassination instead of keeping his efforts on philosophic thought. To Homer, he laments that he wished he could know Greek (a language that was lost to Latin speakers at the time) to speak with him and know how his great works
                sounded in his original language. These letters prompted this movement toward classical antiquity, many Latin philosophers like Poggio Bracciolini and Cencio Romano dei Rusticci to seek out more “forgotten texts” to study and learn from them. The study of Greek
                translation to Latin also followed, as Petrarch anticipated the translations of Homer’s works by his friend Pilato.

            <p class="hide txt" id="luther-text">Luther was born in 1483 and died on 1546. His contributions direct contributions to Renaissance humanism were limited but his actions in attempting to reform the Catholic church and spurring many Protestant sects in his wake including
                Lutheranism cannot be understated. Luther started his religious work as an academic, being an Augustinian friar. He lived his early years in constant fasting, pilgrimage, and prayer while also in spiritual turmoil, feeling that he had lost touch with God and the savior.
                Later he would be a dean to University of Wittenberg teaching theology, eventually receiving his Doctor of Theology in 1512 and claiming the chair of theology at the university in 1515. Beginning his reformation of the Catholic Church, Luther wrote his famous 95 Theses
                to the bishop Albrecht von Brandenburg, stating his distaste for the sale of indulgences, sola fide (justification by faith alone), and corrupt practices by the Church, namely their accumulation of wealth, building of grand churches instead of assisting the starving poor.
                Afterward, Luther was excommunicated and was present for the Diet of Worms where Luther was asked to recant his writing or face holy punishment. Luther could not recant the writings as escaped to Wartburg Castle under the guise of fake kidnapping. At the castle, Luther
                translated the New Testament to German (which was previously inaccessible to common folk as it was only in Greek.) Luther continued writing with more thoughts on reformation of the Church including not justifying holy wars against the Turks and ideas of private confession
                as opposed to public confession with an ordained minister. The German translation of the New Testament became more popular and by 1527 Luther met with the Electorate of Saxony to start Lutheranism. Luther’s actions spurred more translations of the Bible including William
                Tyndale’s English version in 1525. Humanists followed suit and skepticism and critique of the Church soon became the topic of many humanist works and arguments.  </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="durer-text">Born in 1471, Albrecht Durer was a painter and theorist during the German Renaissance. After marrying, he traveled to Italy to study art in an environment that was more advanced in its techniques. There he studied how to make prints and
                woodcuts during his time under Wolgemut. Unlike most artists, Durer’s work was experienced through prints, rather than the original work. He was also thought to sympathize with Luther and his Reformation of the Church, due to the nature of some of his pieces as well
                as the contents of his diary and letters. All of his theoretical works were written in German instead of the traditional Latin, allowing for the masses to understand what it was he was trying to say. All of his books were art based, focusing in geometry and proportions
                in order to make art appealing. </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="brunel-text"> Brunelleschi was born in 1377 and died in 1446. Born in Florence to Brunellesco di Lippo, a notary, and Giuliana Spini. Little is known about his early life other than that he received a literary and mathematical education so he could
                be a civil servant like his father. But being artistically inclined he joined the Arte della Seta a silk merchants' Guild which also included goldsmiths, and became a master goldsmith in 1398. Brunelleschi became famous for two panel paintings illustrating linear perspective.
                In 1401 Brunelleschi made "The Sacrifice of Isaac" a bronze relief for a compaction to design the doors of the Florence baptistery. He lost the commission to Lorenzo Ghiberti. After his defeat he went to Rome with his friend Donatello to study Roman art and architecture for
                two years (1402–1404), when he returned he would start working as a architect. Brunelleschi would receive his first architectural commission in for the Ospedale degli Innocenti (Foundling Hospital) it was the first building in Florence that resembled classical antiquity in what
                would become the Renaissance style. And in 1420 on August 7 he would win the commission to design and build the dome for the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore (The Florence Cathedral) and was named head builder. Also called the Duomo it is the biggest missionary dome in the
                world. In order to build such a big dome Brunelleschi had to invent new equipment. The completion of the Duomo is widely conceded the start of the Renaissance.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="fedele-text">She lived from 1465 to 1558 primarily in Venice, Italy. Fedele was known as an orator, writer, and humanist. Her focus was toward classical humanism as presented by early humanists like Petrarch and Boccaccio. Thus, she greatly supported the study
                of the liberal arts, especially to women acknowledging, “immersion in scholarship might do for the weaker sex in general, since I myself intend to pursue immortality through such study.” She agrees with classical Greek thought in logic, “Those who do not develop their capacity for
                reason cannot achieve great things”, agreeing with the Republic by Plato that philosophers should govern the state. Besides being courted by kings, queens, poets, professors, and churchmen for her approval of their work as Diana Robin put, she gave three orations to the University
                of Padua with an audience full of male learned men and humanists.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="cologne-text">Italy was not the only area to experience the effects of the Renaissance. The Germans also made advances in architecture, art, invention, and humanist thought a bit after the Italian movement. The famous German humanist, Conrad Celtis,
                studied in Cologne for a time. He was unafraid to travel into pagan thought despite being a Christian himself, and was perhaps the first to popularize studying history of the entire world. The biggest contribution was perhaps the printing press by Gutenberg, whose impact
                was only further pronounced with the printing of Martin Luther’s German translation of the Bible. In Cologne, the city had notable advancements in art, and architecture. The Cologne School of Painting, existing since 1350, focused on French painting, Gothic painting, and
                Flemish painting chronologically. The school was able to succeed because Cologne at the time was one of the most prosperous cities in all the renaissance, with 42,000 inhabitants alone, as well as how popular Christian art had been. For architecture, the Cologne city hall
                was updated with a Renaissance style loggia in 1567.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="sackofrome-text">The Sack of Rome was a military assault on the city of Rome in 1527. Because of the decision from the Pope to support France, an army of Spaniards, Germans, and Italians marched on the city to destroy what they could and take the rest.
                The cause of this was because the Pope no longer wanted the Church to be dependent on the Holy Roman Empire. The results of this brutal massacre of the papal state severally reduced the power that the pope had amongst the other nations that were forming. This ended the
                Renaissance in Rome and allowed the Emperor to do as he pleased in regards to Luther’s Reformation. </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="florence-text">Florence was a major hub of the Renaissance. It was one of the first places to experience the growth of science, art, architecture and outlooks towards life. Because of the vastly wealthy Medici family, many artists flourished from
                their patronage. Florence was home to thinkers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio and others of the humanist persuasion. It was also home to those such as Michelangelo, da Vinci, and Botticelli. </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="leon-text">Alberti lived from February 14, 1404 to April 25, 1472. Born in Genoa his father was a wealthy Florentine who was exiled from Florence. Alberti was sent to a boarding school in Padua, and would go on to study law at Bologna. While in school
                he distinguished himself as a writer, and wrote a successfully play by the age of twenty. When he graduated he lived in Florence till 1431 when he moved to Rome to take holy orders and enter the service of the papal court. In 1435, he wrote his first major  work the Della
                pittura which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence. But in 1438 encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d'Este of Ferrara he began to focus more on architecture, and got his first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the facade of the Rucellai
                Palace in Florence. By 1447 he became the architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved with several projects at the Vatican. In 1452 he would write his most influential work De Re Aedificatoria (On the Art of Building), which was inspired by Roman architect
                and engineer Vitruvius’ De architectura. De Re Aedificatoria was not fully published until 1485. Would be the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance, and a major reference for architects.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="davinci-text">Leonardo da Vinci was born in Florence in 1452. He is often known as an embodiment of a
                “Renaissance Man”. He was a renowned artist, inventor, and philosopher. Some of his most
                well-known works as an artist include The Last Supper, The Mona Lisa and The Vitruvian Man.
                As an inventor he created many drafts of his ideas, his most famous being his flying machines.
                As a philosopher Leonardo strongly refused both metaphysics and religion. Leonardo’s
                philosophical views were greatly influenced by the natural world around him. It is this focus on
                nature and a desire to understand it that made Da Vinci a compelling humanist. The core beliefs
                shared amongst humanists and their focus on nature, with little concern for metaphysics or
                religion, dictate the other aspects of Leonardo’s life. The strong use of figures and his
                understanding of the human form as demonstrated in his art are perfect examples of his humanist
                ideals being applied.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="london-text">Although the English Renaissance was delayed compared to the Italian Renaissance there were
                still bountiful achievements made. This was the time of Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth, Inigo
                Jones, and Ben Jonson.
                St. Paul’s Cathedral began construction during this time and is an astounding
                architectural marvel. Every inch is covered in intricate detail and art work, with towering
                columns and domes overhead.
                There was also a mighty sensation sweeping the nation during this time called the English
                Reformation. This caused great theological upheaval and debate amongst scholars and clergy
                alike. These discussions would eventually lead to the birth of the Anglican Church, with the
                royal family at the head.
                The life of the average working class was grueling and unkind. Simple one to two room
                housing was all that they could often afford. The luxurious housing often displayed in
                renaissance presentations was reserved for only the wealthiest of families. Many were poor and
                justice was harsh. Public punishment was common for those who sought a way to supplement
                their income.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="machiavelli-text">Famed mainly for his divisive political writings, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527) also worked as a playwright and historian in Florence.  His political experience came from his varied work for the Florentine republic as second chancellor,
                a member of the city-state’s war council, a military advisor, and a liaison with France and the Papal states.  Upon the return of the Medici as the ruling family of Florence, he was imprisoned and tortured on charges of conspiracy.  It was after his release that he wrote his
                most prominent works, The Prince and Discourses on Livy, both published posthumously.  The Prince focuses on the necessary values of a monarch or autocrat, while his Discourses on Livy instead focuses on his preferred form of government, republics.
                Machiavelli’s most debated and widely-read work today is The Prince. Unlike many others, he recommended not that rulers be kind, pious, and honest; rather, he espoused that a leader needs to be able to eschew these more traditional virtues, acting in violent or duplicitous
                ways when necessary to maintain order and protect their kingdom while putting on a face of goodness and virtue to their people.  Thus a leader should not be a slave to honor and virtue, being at times “like a fox” in their cunning, but they should also not shy away from a
                fight when it is due, being “like a lion” in their swift and brutal administration of violence when necessary.  This is also the foundation of his assertion that it is “safer to be feared than loved” if a ruler cannot be both, but must ensure that even if they “[do] not
                inspire love… [they do] not provoke hatred.”  These realistic and borderline cynical views departed from the traditional values of Christian monarchs and marked the beginning of modern political thinking, one of many disciplines to gain its start during the Renaissance.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="michelangelo-text">Michelangelo as born in Florence in 1475. He was a rival of Leonardo da Vinci, and was also
                considered to be a renaissance man due to his broad expertise in a multitude of areas. These areas
                included painting, architecture, sculpture, poetry and philosophy. Much like Leonardo,
                Michelangelo was a humanist. He would create astounding figures that awed all those who saw
                them. His most famous painting is perhaps the one covering the Sistine Chapel. Other artists
                were so inspired by the impact that Michelangelo’s paintings had that they would attempt to
                imitate his style. This would result in the creation of a new art movement known as Mannerism.
                Michelangelo’s David is a key piece that demonstrates the significance of the human
                form during this time period. David was a prime example of the philosophical and theological
                shift taking place during the Renaissance. The glory of god was now emphasized in the human
                form, which had not been done before. Combining Christian views with humanist symbolism
                and ideals would shape the rest of renaissance art and define some of the most iconic pieces to
                come from this era.</p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="para-text"> Born in the early 1400s as Theophrastus Von Hohenheim, Paracelsus was a Renaissance man that led the German medical Renaissance. He graduated from the University of Ferrara, and became known as the father of modern toxicology.
                Using his understanding of chemistry and biology, Paracelsus determined that a poison is only a poison if the dosage is too high, which became a defense of his use of chemicals in the treatment of diseases. What would be a poison in large doses could act as
                a curative if given in a smaller amount. The use of chemicals came from his study of the elements, where he created the Mercury-Sulfur-salt model of medicine, stating that these three were important based on what he knew of medieval alchemy. He stated that
                salt represented the body, Mercury the spirit, and sulfur the soul. Too much of one in the body was said to be the cause of the body’s illness. Both of these, either in principle or practice, became the foundation of modern medicine. </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="shake-text">Although the exact date of his birth in unknown, many people believe that William Shakespeare was born in April of 1564. Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright, the most famous playwright in the world. He was also an
                actor and the creator of the Globe Theatre. His works include tragedy, comedy, and historical works. Very little about his life is actually known, as no autobiographical letters, diaries, or descendants have survived to modern day. Shakespeare received his
                education from King’s New School in Stratford, where he studied Latin and participated in theatre. At age 18, Shakespeare married a woman named Anne Hathaway, that was 8 years older and already had a child. The couple had three children, one dying at age 11
                from unknown reasons. He retired from working on stage in 1610 and finished his last great work in 1613. William Shakespeare died on April 23rd, 1616 and was buried at the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford. His most famous works include Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo
                and Juliet, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, etc. Shakespeare was one of the most influential figures in English literature, as well as the art of playwriting.

            <p class="hide txt" id="constan-text">Following a 53-day siege the Ottoman empire seized Constantinople from the Byzantine’s, in May 1453, resulting in the fall of their empire. This marked a notable shift in power between Christian and Islam territories, as the
                Byzantine empire had existed since 27 BC, almost a 1500 year reign. This event moved the center of the Greek Orthodox Church to Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, instead of the Middle East. Prior to and after the siege many Greek scholars fled the city.
                With them they brought their writings and knowledge. They were accepted in Italy mostly and their writings contributed to the middle Renaissance development. This knowledge covered the whole spectrum of humanist thought including: poets, writers, printers,
                musicians, astronomers, architects, academics, artists, scribes, philosophers, scientists, politicians and theologians. It is rumored that Christopher Columbus was one of these emigrants due that a good amount of his writings were written in Greek.
            </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="more-text">Born in the late 1470s, Thomas More served as key counselor to King Henry VIII of England. He is very well known for his book Utopia, written in 1516. He coined the word “Utopia” as an ideal political system in which policies
                are governed by reason. More attended St. Anthony’s School in London and went on to study at Oxford University. While at Oxford, he spent two years mastering Latin and formal logic, writing comedies, and studying Greek and Latin literature. However, More’s
                father brought him back to London in 1494 to study common law. Although torn between civil service and a monastic calling, More decided to work toward becoming a monk and therefore, moved to a monastery outside the London city limits. He entered Parliament
                in 1504, when his sense of duty to serve his country in government overcame his desire to be a monk. He wrote History of King Richard III, which was considered the first masterpiece of English historiography and later influenced writers such as William
                Shakespeare. More was tried for treason and beheaded in 1535, after refusing the accept the king as head of the Church of England.
            </p>
            <p class="hide txt" id="split-text">The birth of the Anglican Church began under the rule of Henry VIII. Henry sought to annul his
                marriage with his wife, however when he approached the pope for the annulment the pope had
                declined the request. Due to these disputes between Henry and the Catholic Church he attempted
                to lay claim as the head of the church. Other factors that contributed to the English reformation
                include the invention of the printing press, the fall of feudalism, rise of nationalism and the
                implementation of common law. In 1534 Henry created the Act of Supremacy which made him
                the supreme head of the church. He would then gain the ability to appoint archbishops which
                would then annul his marriage. The church of England would change greatly with each following
                successor to the throne.
                The philosophical basis that lead to the radical shift in theological thinking was from a
                man named John Wycliffe. He put a great deal of significance into the law provided by the
                scripture and believed it contained all that a man would need to live his life by. Together with
                Martin Luther’s ideas circulating and being discussed across England, these ideas shaped the
                beginnings of the Anglican Church.</p>
